code literacy - Can they quickly read and understand code?
code robustness - Do they handle input/output/error expectations properly? Are they asking for system requirements for error handling and recovery?
code testability + insight - Can they write testable code? Are they inclined to suggest useful tests, i.e. conditions that should and could happen, or useless unit tests that will never fail? Do they provide some options or methods to help debug or troubleshoot the code in production? 
code clarity - Is the code that they write clear and readable by others? Do they provide necessary context, or perhaps too much redundant context? Is it easily digestible, and if not, well commented?

understand the requirements (or generate them if necessary!) and success criteria
work with the consumers of the code 
get something working and prove it is working (as much as possible)
repeat the above steps in intervals compatible with the consumers until the success criteria is met
